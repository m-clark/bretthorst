Leo GÃ¼rtler reached out to me a long time ago regarding converting some code for an analytical Bayesian t-test to R.  I meant at that point to create a repo, but never actually did, until now.  The next step will be to take a look at the code and eventually optimize it.

From Leo:
> I converted two independent Mathematica scripts (one from UM Studer from the 90's, the other from the online supplement from the book of P. Gregory) to R. Both work and can reproduce the numbers of Bretthorsts original article (those numbers are an example from Jaynes).
